              Many avid readers will probably agree that Stephen King’s IT is
              one of his most disturbing novels. In IT, seven adults who were
              once childhood friends return to Derry, Maine, where they once
              fought a creature that preyed on the town’s vulnerable children.
              As teenagers, they believed they had defeated the creature, but
              they made a pact to return to Derry if the horror ever resurfaced.
              Thirty years later, with news of child murders terrorizing Derry,
              the adults must once again confront the evil force they thought
              they had vanquished.

              It would be a mistake not to include this Stephen King masterpiece
              at the top of this list. Middle-aged writer Jack Torrance, a
              troubled recovering alcoholic, hopes to overcome his writer’s
              block by moving with his family to the historic and isolated
              Overlook Hotel for winter, where he will work as a winter
              caretaker. At first, Jack believes the hotel is the perfect place
              to regroup and reconnect with his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, but
              the hotel holds a truly dark past that threatens to torment him
              until he destroys his family. Young Danny, Jack’s son, has “the
              shining,” a psychic ability to see the hotel’s dark past and its
              evil influence on his father’s troubled psyche.

              In John Ajvide Lindqvist’s Let the Right One In, Lindqvist follows
              the lives of two unlikely characters: Oskar, a lonely 12-year-old
              boy, and Eli, a mysterious vampire child. Oskar, a bullied middle
              schooler, lives with his mother in one of the blocks of flats in a
              drab neighborhood in Blackeberg, a deserted Stockholm suburb
              during the early 1980s. When Oskar and Eli meet and strike an
              unlikely friendship, it brings more excitement to Oskar’s life
              than he could ever imagine. This friendship leads Oskar to develop
              special abilities, which he uses to confront his bullies at
              school.

              First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill
              House has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is
              the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly
              pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking
              for solid evidence of a “haunting;” Theodora, his lighthearted
              assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well
              acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill
              House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky
              encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering
              its powers — and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.
